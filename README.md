# Failure UHC - Modded Minecraft UHC Engine

A simple (at the moment) mod to facilitate running UHC matches on 1.8, with the option of allowing a controlled list of mods.

Currently in development, planned features for first release are:

* Bedrock Arena Wall (done)
* Deadly Rabbits (done)
* 'Spectate on Death' (done)
* Mod Whitelist (done)
* Chat Controls (done)
* Game Timing (planned)
* Disable beds (planned)
* Waiting Area structure (planned)

Future releases will include team controls, and additional game rules, as well as things I haven't thought of yet.
