# Failure UHC - Modded Minecraft UHC Engine

A simple (at the moment) mod to facilitate running UHC matches on 1.8, with the option of allowing a controlled list of mods.

Currently in development, features for first release are:

* Bedrock Arena Wall
* Deadly Rabbits
* 'Spectate on Death'
* Mod Whitelist
* Chat Controls
* Game Timing
* Waiting Area structure

Future features will include:

* Disable beds
* Disable Nether Portals
* Team Support
* Pregenerate Arena command
* Many other things
* And probably stuff

Future releases will include team controls, and additional game rules, as well as things I haven't thought of yet.
